    Physical Symbols System Hypothesis
    Raw group of intergrouping

    Matching patterns
    Combination Explosion
        More combinations to process

# Strong and Weak API
    Strong:: (General AI)
        Machine displays all person-like behavior
        Learn a new languague
    Weak:: (Narrow AI)
        Machine is confirmed to a very narrow task.
        Example:: Apple siri
        uses Symbolic approach [ Matching the pattern and responding]

# Machine Learning
    Instead of expert creating a list of patterns, Machine creates its own list of patterns.

# Perceptrons

    ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)

    1990 Deep Learning
        Many hidden layers
        Back Propagation
        Clustering
            Create categories
            Sort them quickly
            Pattern matchings for Patterns
    Machine Lerning > Symbolic reasoning

# Yahoo vs Google
    Web crawling

# Where
    Symbolic reasonging = Abstract problems but know steps
                            Long Setup and no outside data
    Machine Learning    = Look for large Patterns
                          Lots of data that needs tweeking

# Unsupervised Learning

    Supervised Learning

# Back Propagation

# Regression

# Generative AI
    Deep Learning Neural Networks create a foundation model

    Use Foundation Model...train a domain specific knowledge.
