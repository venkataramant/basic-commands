# Who are the parties
	StakeHolders -- High level Objectives
	Project Management -- Risk,Schedule, budget
	Engineering Specialists -- Implementable description, flexibility
	
	System Engineering is to meet needs of 3 groups and coordinate all 3 aspects to create and design a System.
	
	Goal:: Design and Optimization
	
# what is System Engineering

	1. Project Objectives
		- 2. Concept Formulations [Create multiple options, roll out and pick one that meets all needs]
			- 3.1 Decompose and Define
				- 3.2 Decompose and Define until 
					all components are simple enough to implement.
					- 4. Implement
						5.1 Integrate
							5.1 Integrate these small components 
								review and re-adjust

# Challenges
	1. Are these the right components?
		Functionally, logically and Physically
	2. Do they meet the needs of the higher system?
	3. Are they compatible?
	
# Phrases
		- tough cross functional problems
		1. Create components and their interactions in diagram
		2. analyze and simulate
		3. review, feedback and update
		4. Repeat
	
	Concept Review --> System Requirements Review --> System Design review --> Preliminary design reviews

# Complex
	Interdependencies
	
	Processes
	Tools
# Tasks
	- Stakeholder needs 
		[What does the system need to do?]
	- Concept Exploration 
		[Examine potential system concepts]
	- Performance requirements
		[What are the key characteristics]
	- Functional analysis and Formulations
		[Functional,physical, logical architectures]
	
	- Case Studies and Proof of concepts
	- Detailed Development
		[ Low-level requirements define subsystems configuration]
