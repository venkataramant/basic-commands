# Steps
	1. List out Product high level features
		End User perspective
		Internal (Business Insights)
	
	
	2. Use-Cases (Requirements)
		Ask for clarifying what use-case to concentrate
		Constrain the problem to make it solvable within timeframe.
		functional and Non-Functional Requirements
	
	3. Numbers/High Level Metrics (Traffic)
		Storage (Core Data + Metadata)
		Network
		Compute
		Growth rate + Buffer capacity
	
	4. High Level API Design
		Create a contract between API interface and functionalities scope
	
	5. High Level Component 
		Design and talk 
	6. Design Data Models
		Data Models
		Drill down database requirements and technologies
	7. Algorithms approaches for API Interface
		Caching
		Chunk the data
	
		(web-socket/grpc)
	8. Performance,Scaling, Availability (PSA)
	
		Application Server and Flows
		Database Layer flow
		Caching (Before DB/S3 or Inside Application Layer)
	
	9. Bottlenecks and remedies
