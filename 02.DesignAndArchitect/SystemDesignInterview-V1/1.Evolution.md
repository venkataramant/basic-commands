# Evolution

# Step 1: Single Layer for Application and Data
	
	Single Instance
		Application + Database Server
	Scaling:
		Vertical scaling
	Issue:
		Single Point of Failure
		Exposed data and process directly to internet.
# Step 2: Separation of Application and Data Layers
	Separate Instances for Application and Database Servers.
	Both of them scaled indepdently
	Database server can run on private network

	Scaling:
		Vertical scaling
	Issue:
		Single Point of Failure

# Step 3: LoadBalancer & Replciation
	Introduce LoadBalancer and Replications

	Add Multiple Application servers
	A loadbalancer infront of them
	Loabalancer has public IP and Application servers run on private network.Application server nodes can be spread across different geographical locations near to customer

	Database servers are divided into write nodes and replication nodes.
	Writes are performed on Master Node.
	Master node has 1 or more replication nodes.
	Reads are spread across replication nodes.
	These replications nodes can be spread across different geographical locations near to customer

	Scaling:
		Vertical scaling
	Advantages:
		1. Reduce latency/Performance
		2. Fault tolerance 
		3. Data backup
	Challenges:
		1. Maintaining state of sessions
		2. Complex architecture
		3. Data Replciation dealys [split mode]
	LoadBalancing Techniques:
		1. RoundRobin
		2. Weighted RoundRobin
		3. StickySessions
		4. Hashing
		5. Consistent Hashing

# Step 4: CDN and Cache
	Introducing CDN for static content and Caching for reducing heavy reads

	As user base increasing, there is lot of load on application servers and Database Servers.
	Some of these content are static in nature, those can be cached and served different.

	CDN- <<Definition>>
	Caching - <<Defintion>>

	Advantages:
		1. CDNs are located in every region , very close to customers.
		2. Improve performance and latency as lot of static data is downloaded from CDN servers which are spread across the globe
		3. Static data from Databases can be stored in Caching Servers(Redis/Memcache), hence reduing lot of read/network traffic
		4. Reduce Network load on actual Databases/Application servers
	Challenges:
		1. May have stale information
		2. Eviction and Expiry challenges
		3. With improper configs, there may be heavy load on CDNs and Caching Servers
	Techniques:
		1. Last Recently Used (LRU)
		2. Least Frequently Used (LFU)
		3. Setting Expiration on content in Cache/CDN
# Step 5: Async- MQ

	Instead of long running activities in Sync mode. In order to improve latency and peformance, We peformance lot of business logic in asyn mode, so the customers  recieve acknowledgement for their actions. Actual business processing happens in asyn mode and notifies the customer later through notication services.

	Processors are divided as Data Producer and Consumers and MQ is used to store and share the data between these process without knowing each other

	Advantages:
		1. Producers and Consumers are separated,can be scalled separately
		2. Introducing of MQs enables doing multiple tasks at time. eg: Risk/fraud detection,Notifying customers, Realtime metrics for business
		3. Improved Latency and performance by decoupling lot of process and running them separately.
	Challenges:
		1. State management
		2. Order of execution of messages
		3. Handling of Failures and Retries
		4. Handling duplication process

# Step 6: Stateless and Sharding [Store Session data]
	
	Application servers have session data, forcing requests of customers has to go same Application Servers.

	HotSpot issues in DataLayer. one particular records have heavy read/write operations 
	Sharding: <<Defitioin>>

	Strategies:
		1. Application Servers has to use Cache/Database(KV) to store session data, hence a request can be processed by any applciation server.
		2. To avoid Hot spots, introduce sharding at database layer
	Advantages:
		1. Further improvement on availability (node failures did not cause of loss of session data)
		2. Sharding helps to distribute load acrsoss the multiple nodes.
	Challenges:
		1. Sharding keys
		2. Resharding may be difficult
		3. Cannot run some join queries as data spread across different physical databases. [Denormalization and store data as required to run complex queries]
		4. Improved distribution of data
		5. More complex to manage a sharded database.
# Step 7: Logging,Tracing, Monitoring,Metrics, Automations
	 As applciations are growing bigger and bigger
	 Logging/Tracing/Metrics
		 1. Application and Business metrics
		 2. Node level metrics
		 3. Tracing  distributed processes/transations for Understanding and debugging purpose
	 Monitoring and Alerting
		 1. Discover and Detect any hardware/software/process/Network failure
		 2. Time to detect
		 3. Alerting operations and engineering teams
		 4. Visualization 

	 Automations:
		 1. Testing,Building and Deployment
		 2. Auto scaling (Up/Down) based upon load/performance

# Step 8: Security [TLS,Authentication and Authorication, Encryption] and Compression
	Security:
		1. TLS enabled
			Server Certs and Client Certs [Mutual Authenication]
		2. Authentication(SSO)
			UserID/PWD/Token/OAuth/JWT
		3. Authorization (Permissions)
			IAM/JWT
		4. Encryption Keys (Shared/Public keys)
			Encrypt the sensitive data at Transit/Rest
	Compression:
		1. Use Compression of data while transmitting and storing to save Network/Storage costs
		2. Improve latency and performance

# Step 9: Database management and Data Integration
	SQL/NoSQL/Object Storage/Big Data

		Based upon data format,usage, we have to use different SQL/NoSQL/ObjectStorage/DFS

		SQL:
			1. traditional and well known usages for structured data
			2. When Consistency is critical and Structure is important
		NoSQL:
			Types: a. Document
				   b. K/V
				   c. Graph Database
				   d. Columnar Database [Vector]
			1. Non-Structual databases
			2. Availability is critical
		Object Storage:
			For Non-Text formats of data(Image/Audio/Video/files/Documents..etc)
			1. Not a natural fit for SQL and NoSQL to store them.
			2. File size is very big
			3. Have its own heirarchy [Folders or files System]
		Distributed File System:
			1. To store historical data 
			2. To run for AI/ML jobs
	Data Movement and Integration
		1. Change Data Capture
			debezium and wal2json
		2. File Formats
			Parquet
			Avro
			Arrow
			ORC
		3. Chunk the bigger data into smaller ones for parallel processing
