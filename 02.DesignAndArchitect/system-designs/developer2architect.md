What to do as Architect?

 Documentation on Latest Language/Framework/Project
 Prepare a proof of concepts
 Review current code (Known/Unknow bugs)

 *Spot the problems and fix them at lighting speed
  An Architect is a developer with a lot of experience.

  As a Software Architect, need to focus on a complete system,its interactions and relationships as well as professionals working on different areas who are working on it.

  Code --> Business Objectives and Organizational interests.

Role of Architect/Tech Lead:: (Softskills and Leadershiop)
	Tech Lead focus on their teams to make them better and best.
	Architect concentrates on making the Product better.

	Important things (Based upon env, context and tech resources)
	Architecture encompasses the decisions that have long-term impact and implications on a piece of software.
	Having a great vision, a high degree of technical expertise and knowledge mixed with soft skills, including influence,participation and leadership.

Tools for Architect::
	Achieve new Goals

	paradoxically -- (2 opposite ideas)
		1. pulling away developer tools and skills a little away
		2, Improving softskills, strategy and complex decision-making.

	Mind-Mapping Technic: 
		is used to visuaulize and organize ideas or projects.(subdividing problems into simpler parts)
		  1. Writing down a main idea.
		  2. Add Secondary ideas and Branches
		  3. From each of them, a few more

		  a. Noting the concepts of a meeting, to completely organizing the concepts of a project.
	Pareto Priniciple:
		For strategic decision making
		20:80 Rule
		20% of efforts generates 80% of the impact.
		20% of problems generates 80% of the efforts.

		How and When to Act When resources are limited
		Strategic vision to pick the right battle.

	As Architecture looks for tools and techniques that will help you make the best decisions.
		1. Keeping track of industry with our own hype cycle [Emerging technologies or innovation funnel]
	To better manage data and ideas, reduce NOISE, and better distinguish important information.

	Focused on decision-making  -- A Clear picture and define the path for the solutions to be created.

Organization Structure:
	People:: Think and Interact affects the final product.

	Conway's Law:
		[O]rganizations which design systems (in the broad sense used here) are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.

		Understand how to plan a solution that fits the business culture in which it is developed.

		Create a communication flow that reflects the needs of the product to be created.

		Carefully examine Orgainization and communication structure.

Develoepr2Architect:
	Is a long and complex process,mainly one has to rethink onself often.
	Not just improving the skills but changing them.
	Change the Mindset
		Set Mindset to not receptive to interpreting information.

	Developer: [Proactive mindset]
		Creating concrete solutions
		Correcting mistakes
		Taking requirements, turning them into tangible results.
	Architect: [Reactive mindset] 
		[How to process the information, solve the problem, how to approach] [Aligned vision and goals]

		Focus on satisfying needs.
		Deep understanding of client or the product, Detect what the need is. [Analyse data,resources, technical feasibilities]
		Spans many disciplines
			Gather key information

		Abundance of humility and an understanding that there are many right paths to reach the same point.

		Ex:
			A road between cities
				1. Analyze the distances, shortest routes, projected flows of vehicles
				2. Bridges required, defines the shape of the road
				3. Speed of vehicles, number of lanes needed
			Engineers deliver the road
			Architect
				1. Widening the road or connecting other cities.


Software Architect feeds on their experience as developers, having a deep knowledge of software and what is required to craete it,is the fundamental basis from which the rest of this professional profile is built.

	Knowledge is not same as Experience/Expertise.
	State of the industry
	Needs of the client
	Current state of technology
Improve effectiveness and optimze the cost of a solution.

	Goals of Architect
			Concrete solution
			Sustainable over the time
			Grow accordingly to user needs
			High level of efficiency
			Generate value for the client.
	Domain-Driven Design:
		Existing model or knowledge
		Domain must be mapped in detail.
		Best to create a flexible and modular structure as
		model/knowledge is constantly evolving and being refined.
		Iterative --> to reflect constant improvements in the software as well as knowledge acquired about the domain.

	Architecture Design patterns

		Using proven solutions for repetitive tasks.

		Structure, Communication and operation of software parts.
		Granular problmes within a piece of code <<==>> encompasses entire project and always mode it from a macroscopic perspective.
			Layered Architecture
			Event-Driven Architecture
			Microkernel Architecture
			Microservice pattern

	Adopt at dizzying spead
	Change is the only thing that's constant
	Agility is prevailing Trait
	Move Quickly and Embrace change
	Cultivate an attitude of Continous Improvement

	Extreme Programming
	Kanban
	Scrum -- Iterative Process
		Incorporate uncertainity and lack of knowledge
		Functional product with incremental improvements.
		Sprint Zero --To rein and analyze the main goal of the project, new functionalities and define the guidelines for developers to integration.
		Agility:-> Adapting and being ready to change plans
	SAFe Framework
		Hardening Pi/Incremental improvements
			Architecture and key Metrics are improved.
	Carried away
Project constraints/Limits
	Striving for excellence and Pushing quality
	Limits and constraints
	Creating key metrics for performances

Software Qualities
	Testability
	Usability
	Readability
	Flexibilty
	Operability
	Portability
	Resilience
	Security
	Accuracy
	Modularity
	HA
	Performance

Software System Design
	Designers mainly conentrate on design plans that delves into the different elements that make up a system.

	Software design show us how all these parts work together to meet the requirements of the system.

	Software Architecture functions as an overall blueprint for building a software system. Architecture helps to manage the complexity of the system and establishes a mechanism for communication and coordination between components.


	Requirements 
		[Business, measurable]
	High level Design 
		[Broadly defines the operation of the system]
	Detailed software design
		-- Seeks to look deeper into the more specific parts of the modules or parts that make up a system.

	Both Software architecture and desing requires high level  vision and considerable experience with innovative and proven approaches to help teams make the best decisions in the planning phase.

Common pitfalls for Software Architectures
	Lack of Domain knowledge
	Assumptions/Technicalities or Repeating patterns that worked for others.
	Big and Small details related to the business
	Not investigating the specific context in which the software solutionis planned to created
	Efforst on Thinking about implementation or infrastructure.

	
		In general, the specifics of the implementation,infrastructure and technical details of production are the work and expertise of the engineers,DevOps engineers and the rest of the team.
	Stay where they can see the big picture
	Be Open to new options and the experience of others while keeping a healthy level of self-criticism.
