# CAP
CAP, in the context of distributed systems and databases, stands for the "CAP Theorem." The CAP Theorem is a principle that highlights the inherent trade-offs between three desirable properties of distributed systems: Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

Here's a brief explanation of each term:

Consistency (C):

In a consistent distributed system, all nodes in the system see the same data at the same time, regardless of where the data is accessed. Achieving consistency ensures that a read operation on any part of the system returns the most recent write.
Availability (A):

Availability guarantees that every request to the distributed system receives a response, without guaranteeing that it contains the most recent version of the data. An available system is one that remains operational even in the presence of failures.
Partition Tolerance (P):

Partition tolerance is the system's ability to continue operating even when network partitions (communication failures) occur between nodes. Network partitions can happen due to various reasons, such as network failures or delays.
The CAP Theorem asserts that it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide all three of these guarantees. In the event of a network partition, a system must choose between consistency and availability. If partition tolerance is a requirement (which is often the case in real-world distributed systems), the system has to sacrifice either consistency or availability during network partitions.

Architects and developers need to consider the implications of the CAP Theorem when designing distributed systems, making decisions based on the specific requirements and characteristics of their applications. Different scenarios may prioritize consistency over availability or vice versa, depending on the application's use case and the expected network conditions.
