# Decompose by Business Capability

	Business Capabilities ==> Application Architecture
	
	eg:
		Product Catalog MGMT == <<Service>> ProductCatalog_Srvc
		Inventory MGMT		 == <<Service>> Inventory_Srvc
		Order MGMT			 == <<Service>> Inventory_Srvc
		Delivery MGMT		 == <<Service>> Delivery_Srvc

# Decompose by Subdomain
	Organization is divided into multiple independent organizations/sub-domains.
	1. WareHouse (Inventory)
	2. Store (Product Catalog)
	3. Accounting(Billing/Order)
	4. Logistics (Delivery)
# Strangler pattern
	To Replace a Monolithic application gradually  by adding more and more micro-services
	The monolith application shrinks over time where as the strangler application grows larger over time.
	
# Bulkhead pattern
	bulkhead -- wall  between different cargo sections to prevent floor or fire and isolate them into same section
	Divided the services into bulkhead groups, failure of one or more services will not impact all or other bulkhead groups. Each of the bulkhead services works independently.

# Sidecar pattern
	Separate non-core/business functionality and run them as independent services along with core-services
	like 1. Proxy to remote services
	     2. Logging
	     3. Configuration
	     4. Platform abstraction
