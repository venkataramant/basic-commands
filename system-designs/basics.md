Systems that consist of multiple autonomous computers that communicate through a network.

# Security Best Practices:

Understanding security principles, encryption, authentication, and authorization.

# Scalability:

Designing systems that can handle increased load by adding resources or nodes.

# DevOps:

The integration of development and operations to improve collaboration and productivity.

# Caching Strategies:

Efficient use of caching to improve performance.

# Load Balancing:

Distributing network or application traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.

# Containerization:

Using technologies like Docker to encapsulate applications and their dependencies for easy deployment.

# Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

Managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable script files.
