	Prometheus ( Collecting metrics)
		Prometheus is an open-source Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) graduate project used for generating alerts and monitoring metrics by using time series data as the source for metrics.
	Jaeger (Distributed Tracing)
		‍Jaeger is also an open-source platform that was created by Uber in 2015 for troubleshooting and monitoring distributed microservice environments with the help of traces.
# Visualization
	Grafana
		Grafana is a free and open source (FOSS/OSS) visualization tool that can be used on top of a variety of different data stores but is most commonly used together with Graphite, InfluxDB, Prometheus, and Elasticsearch. As it so happens, Grafana began as a fork of Kibana, trying to supply support for metrics (a.k.a. monitoring) that Kibana (at the time) did not provide much if any such support for.
	Kibana
		Kibana is the ‘K’ in the ELK Stack, the world’s most popular open source log analysis platform, and provides users with a tool for exploring, visualizing, and building dashboards on top of the log data stored in Elasticsearch clusters.
