# Architecture of Prometheus Server
	Retrieval
		- pulls metric data
	Storage
		- TimeSeries Database
		- stores metric data
	HTTP Server
		- accepts query (PromQL)

	Targets and Metrics (Units)
	Exporter (PushGateway)

	AlertManager
	Prometheus WebUI


# Sample Metrics Format
	- Metrics entities: TYPE and HELP attributes
	- Help ::
	- Type:
		- Counter (Increase Only)
		- Guage (Up and Down with Time)
		- Histogram (How big/long ..etc)
		

# Disk - TimeSeries Database
	Local
	Remote Disk
	
# PromQL
	Examples
		- http_requests_total{status!~"4.."}
		- rate(http_requests_total[5m])[30m:]

# Grafana visualisation
	- Uses PromQL to fetch data to show them in dashboard.
	
# Others
	Reliable
	Stand-alone and self-containing  vs difficult to scale
	no extensive setup required		 
	less complex						vs limit monitoring
