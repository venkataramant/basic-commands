# Realtime processing tools
	Apache Kafka
	Apache Flink
	Apache Storm
	Apache Spark Streaming
	Amazon Kinesis
	Apache Samza

	Apache Kafka: Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is widely used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It provides high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable messaging capabilities.
	
	Apache Flink: Flink is a distributed stream processing framework that supports event-driven, real-time processing of data streams. It offers low-latency processing, exactly-once semantics, and support for complex event processing and stateful computations.
	
	Apache Storm: Storm is a distributed real-time computation system that is designed for processing large volumes of data streams with low latency. It provides fault tolerance, scalability, and support for complex event processing and stream analytics.
	
	Apache Spark Streaming: Spark Streaming is an extension of the Apache Spark processing engine that enables real-time processing of data streams. It offers high-throughput, fault-tolerant stream processing using micro-batch processing techniques.
	
	Amazon Kinesis: Kinesis is a managed streaming service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) for real-time data ingestion and processing. It offers various components such as Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose, and Kinesis Data Analytics for different use cases.
	
	Apache Samza: Samza is a distributed stream processing framework that is designed for fault-tolerant, stateful processing of data streams. It provides a simple programming model and seamless integration with Apache Kafka for message transport.
