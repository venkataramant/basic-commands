# 

# Processing Semantics
	Flink : Event-time processing with exactly once
	Storm : At least once processing
	Spark : Micro batch process with at least once 

# Ease of Use & Abstraction
	Flink : Unified programming model with high-level API
	Storm : Low-level spout-bolt API, more manual configuration
	Spark : High level API

# Latency & Processing Model
	Flink : Low latency processing(sub sec) with event time control
	Storm : Low latency processing(milli sec)
	Spark : Processing in micro batches introducing slight delay.
